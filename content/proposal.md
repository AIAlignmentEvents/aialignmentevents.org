AI Safety Events is a group supporting the realization of events for the AI safety community.

Problem: The field of AI safety is up-and-coming. It doesn't have many dedicated events or representation in the established events. Existing organizations and individual researchers desiring the realization of workshops or socials face an operational burden.

Solution: Creation of an organization dedicated to event operations for the field.


## Theory of change
With *inputs*, we perform *activities*, leading to *outcomes*.

### Activities
- Organize directly a set of events, such as socials and unconferences at AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ...)
- Support event operations (act as service provider) for orgs, multi-orgs, or other topologies
- Maintain an up-to-date list of events of the field
- Build a field-specific knowledge base on event organizing, relevant data, relations, ...
- Event operations skilling-up
- Maintain a Youtube channel of talk recordings
- Proactively support existing events in the field

### Inputs
- Working members
- Direct experience, feedback from participants and community
- Reflection from workers and board
- Funding

### Outcomes
- Event operations capabilities across the field is improved
- Field-specific event organization knowledge base
- Operations upskilling provided for the commmunity
- Opportunities, social network, and professionalism in the field are improved


### Impact evaluation
Every 6 months, the organization leads and board meeting for a review and evaluation of activities. Additionally, a report is published, facilitating review by external impact evaluators.

AI Safety Events participates in the [hypercert](https://hypercerts.xyz/) system to facilitate its impact evaluation and funding.


## Past events

We organized the AI Safety Unconference at NeurIPS in 2018 and 2019.


## Members

### Working members
- Orpheus Lummis, project lead
- Mauricio H. Luduena, administrative assistant

Open community such that interested workers can join and start helping without too much friction.

### Board members

*Official list in preparation*.


## Notes

The organization is to be registered as a non-profit in Qu√©bec, Canada.

The expected counterfactual is that no other group runs events steadily. That is, if this project doesn't run we expect that at AI Alignment socials, unconferences, and workshops at academic conferences will not steadily be realized.

Possible early stopping points:
- If another group starts organizing quality events steadily, or other goals executed by this org, we should consider joining forces.
- If the org leads to negative feedback from the community or poor execution, and the org can not adapt, the org should consider shutting down.

A potential project this org can support is an *AI Alignment Conference*. That is, a yearly academic event gathering the field, with a peer-review publication process, workshops, and side events. Its realization would require a careful approach, brought forward by multiple orgs and individuals of the field, with dedicated operations, etc.
