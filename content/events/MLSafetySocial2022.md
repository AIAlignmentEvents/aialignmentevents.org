Designing systems to operate safely in real-world settings is a topic of growing interest in Machine Learning. As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed, it will become increasingly important that they are safe and beneficial. There is a large community of researchers focused on making current and future systems reliable and aligned with our objectives. For example, OpenAI, Anthropic, Inflection, and DeepMind all have safety teams.Â
