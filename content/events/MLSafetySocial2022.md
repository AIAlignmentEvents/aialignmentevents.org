As ML systems increase in capabilities and integration in society, their safety and alignment grow in importance. We welcome participants interested in or working on AI safety topics for a semi-structured social meetup at NeurIPS 2022. Meet peers who may have read your papers or authors you've read, and build new friendships and collaboration opportunities. We recommend using **[Swapcard](https://app.swapcard.com/event/ml-safety-social-neurips-2022)**, to request **one-one-one meetings** with other attendants, and to **participate in moderated discussions**. (If you would like to facilitate one of these groups **fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrVlah4XmVe83HyJ)**). Example topics include "Establishing trust in advanced AI systems," "Concrete Threat Models," and "AI Governance and Policy".
